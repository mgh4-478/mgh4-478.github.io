							<h3>What&lsquo;s Hashing?</h3>
							<p>
								The hash has been described as a "Drinking Club with a Running Problem." The Hashers meet and run/jog/walk a short trail. Then afterwards, they stand or sit around, chatting, drinking beer, soft drinks, water, or whatever they prefer.

								- A flashlight in case of a night run<br/>
								- A hash bag for your belongings<br/>

							<h3>What to expect</h3>
							<p>
								The first and most important thing to know is that a hash is not a race. The only goal of the hash is to get to the end. After everyone has gathered at the start, one or more hashers (the hares) sets a trail for the rest of the hashers (the hounds) to follow. The trail can go through any type of terrain: on dirt roads, down power lines, through swamps, along streets and back alleyways, through shopping center parking lots, over fences, down streams, and through tunnels. Some may be as easy as a walk in the park.

					<h2>Proudly contributing to the decline of civilization in Middle Georgia!</h2>
					<p>
						The Middle Georgia Hash House Harriers & Harriettes (MGH4) and the Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday Hash House Harriers (W3H3) are your local branches of the world-wide "DRINKING CLUB WITH A RUNNING PROBLEM."
					</p>
					<p>
						Anyone who wants to have some fun, drink some beer, and get a bit of exercise, can put on his or her running shoes and meet us for the next trail. There is no formal membership, and we encourage new people to come out and join us.
					</p>
					<p>
						We normally run every other week on Saturday around 2 PM and most Wednesdays at 6:30 PM. Afterwards, we often meet for dinner at a local restaurant.
					</p>
					<p>
						Virgins (First time hashers) pay $5.00 for their first hash, but then the second hash with that same club is free. Thereafter the price is a measly $5.00 for all the beer (or soft drinks/water) snacks and general camaraderie you can stand. (Please drink responsibly.)
					</p>
					<p>
						All it takes to be a hasher is a good sense of humor, and an interest in the outdoors. You definitely do not need to be a great runner.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sound like fun? Want to know more? Check out the "What&lsquo;s Hashing?" and "What To Bring?" sections below. Then when you've made up your mind to come, grab your stuff and meet us at the start. Sometimes the trial info isn't posted until the day before the hash, so please check often.
